# Projects

## Machine Learning
- [**Bike Sharing Demand Analysis:**](https://github.com/HypothesisTester/Kaggle-ML-Notebooks/blob/main/bike-sharing/notebooks/bike-sharing.ipynb) The project employs machine learning to forecast bike sharing demand, leveraging data on rental duration, start/end positions, and environmental factors. The RandomForestRegressor model showed notable predictive accuracy, highlighting temporal and weather-related usage patterns.

## Autonomous Driving
- [**Autonomous Motion Prediction (Lyft L5):**](https://github.com/HypothesisTester/Kaggle-ML-Notebooks/blob/main/Autonomous%20Motion%20Prediction%20%28Lyft%20L5%29/03_inference_and_submission.ipynb) Built a BEV-based motion forecasting pipeline with L5Kit and PyTorch, training a ResNet backbone on rasterised scene context to predict future agent trajectories. Developed companion notebooks for inference/submission and error analysis to benchmark results on the Lyft Level-5 dataset.

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- [**Twitter Sentiment Analysis:**](https://github.com/HypothesisTester/Kaggle-ML-Notebooks/blob/main/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis/notebooks/Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb) The project utilises natural language processing techniques to analyze sentiment from Twitter data, employing logistic regression for classification. The model's performance, indicated by its F1 score and accuracy, showcases effective sentiment distinction. This analysis aids in understanding public opinion trends on social media platforms. The link to the dataset is [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mayurdalvi/twitter-sentiments-analysis-nlp)

## Data Analysis and Visualisation
- [**Movies Dataset - Exploratory Analysis:**](https://github.com/HypothesisTester/Kaggle-ML-Notebooks/blob/main/fandango-eda/notebooks/Fandango_EDA.ipynb) Exploratory Analysis of Fandango's ratings in 2015 using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Seaborn visualisations to identify if there was a bias towards rating movies better to sell more tickets.
